 * The daily puzzle, as a match controller.
 *
 * Single-player, so there's no opponent and no turn order — but it exposes the
 * same shape as the other controllers (view/on/guess/quit) so the UI layers can
 * treat it the same way.
 *
 * Progress is saved after every guess, not just at the end. Closing the tab
 * mid-puzzle and coming back should resume exactly where you were, and there is
 * no second chance at a daily, so losing three guesses to a refresh would be
 * genuinely annoying.
