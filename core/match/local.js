 * Two players, one device.
 *
 * The privacy problem is the whole problem here: both codes have to be entered on
 * the same screen, and the device changes hands after every guess. So the match
 * carries a gate — whenever the seat with the move changes, play stops behind a
 * full-screen handoff card until the incoming player confirms they're the one
 * holding it. Codes are masked as they're typed for the same reason.
 *
 * Guess history is public information in this game, so nothing else needs hiding.
