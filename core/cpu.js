 * The CPU codebreaker.
 *
 * The whole search space is only 3024 codes, so even the hardest level can hold
 * every possibility in memory and reason over it exactly. Difficulty is a matter
 * of how much of that reasoning the CPU is willing to do.
 *
 *   rookie — plays hunches. Only remembers its two most recent clues, and often
 *            throws a wild guess anyway. Beatable.
 *   racer  — perfect bookkeeping: guesses a code that fits every clue so far,
 *            picked at random. Solves in roughly 6 rounds.
 *   ace    — picks the guess that splits the remaining possibilities most
 *            evenly, so each clue cuts as deep as it can. Roughly 4-5 rounds.
